**Final Project: Air Quality Analysis**
This is the final project of Dicoding in the course "Learn Data Analysis With Python" to perform analysis and create a dashboard from an air quality dataset. In the notebook file, I attached how I carried out analysis starting from Data Wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis, to Data Visualization. Additionally, I also created a dashboard using Streamlit, and you can check it out by clicking the link in the right sidebar or here.

For more information, such as the background of this dataset, dataset characteristics, file structure, and more, you can view the Readme file. So, here, I will not explain further.
