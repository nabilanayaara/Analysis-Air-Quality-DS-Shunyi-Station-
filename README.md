**Final Project: Air Quality Analysis**
This is the final project of Dicoding in the course "Learn Data Analysis With Python" to perform analysis and create a dashboard from an air quality dataset. In the notebook file, I attached how I carried out analysis starting from Data Wrangling, Exploratory Data Analysis, to Data Visualization. Additionally, I also created a dashboard using Streamlit, and you can check it out by clicking the link in the right sidebar or here.

For more information, such as the background of this dataset, dataset characteristics, file structure, and more, you can view the Readme file. So, here, I will not explain further.

**2. Project work cycle**
A. Data Wrangling:
- Gathering data
- Assessing data
- Cleaning data
B. Exploratory Data Analysis:
- Defined business questions for data exploration
- Create Data exploration
- Data Visualization:
- Create Data Visualization that answer business questions
C. Dashboard:
- Set up the DataFrame which will be used
- Make filter components on the dashboard
- Complete the dashboard with various data visualizations
  
Note: Numbers 1 to 3 are in the dicoding-collection-exercise and number 4 is in dashboard.

**3. Getting Started**
notebook.ipynb
- Download this project.
- Open your favorite IDE like Jupyter Notebook or Google Colaboratory (but in here I will use Google Colab).
- Create a New Notebook.Upload and select the file with .ipynb extension.
- Connect to hosted runtime.
- Lastly, run the code cells.
 dashboard/dashboard.py  
- Download this project.
- Install the Streamlit in your terminal or command prompt using pip install streamlit. Install another libraries like pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and seaborn if you haven't.
- Please note, don't move the csv file because it acts a data source. keep it in one folder as dashboard.py
- Open your VSCode and run the file by clicking the terminal and write it streamlit run dashboard.py.
